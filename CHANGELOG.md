## v160606.80145-RC

- Updating to the latest WPSC.

- Changing the Restriction access prefix in conditionals from `access_res_` to `access_pkg_` as this more accurately describes what is being tested. The `pkg` portion of this suggests you are testing for access to more than one thing, which is exactly the case; i.e., testing for access to an entire Restriction that may offer access in the form of a package. The `access_pkg_` prefix works better with most of the code samples I have been working with; e.g., `[if current_user_can="access_pkg_pro"]` seems better than the term Restriction in the context of what a customer can do.
