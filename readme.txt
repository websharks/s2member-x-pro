WooCommerce Restrictions is a powerful (free) membership plugin for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Protect members only content with WooCommerce. Sell access to Roles, Capabilities, Posts, Pages, Post Types, and/or any other URI pattern. You can also use the `[if current_user_can=""][/if]` shortcode for WordPress to build conditionals around portions of your content and provide access only if a customer has paid you for it.
