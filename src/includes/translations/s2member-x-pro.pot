Just remember that query string variables can appear in any order, as entered by a user. If you check for query strings, use <em>{**&,}</em> and <em>{&**,}</em> around the key=value pair you're looking for. For instance: <em>/example-post{/**,}[?]{**&,}key=value{&**,}</em>. If you're forced to look for multiple variables, the best you can do is: <em>{**&,}key=value{&**&,&,}another=value{&**,}</em>. This still expects <em>key=value</em> to be first, but <em>{&**&,&,}</em> helps some."
