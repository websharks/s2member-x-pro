msgid "Restrictions rely upon PHP as a server-side scripting language. Therefore, you can protect any location (page) served by WordPress via PHP, but you can't protect static files. For instance: <em>.jpg</em>, <em>.pdf</em>, and <em>.zip</em> are static. Generally speaking, if you upload it to the Media Library, it's a static asset. It cannot be protected here. Instead, configure a \"Downloadable Product\" with WooCommerce."
